Release Notes

Neural Network Based
Control System Design
Toolkit

Version 2

Department of Automation, Technical University of Denmark, January 23, 2000

This note contains important information on how the present set of tools is to 
be installed and the conditions under which it may be used. Please read it 
carefully before use.

It is important that the NNSYSID toolbox (Neural Network based SYStem 
IDentification), version 2, has been installed in advance.


INSTALLING THE TOOLKIT
o       The present version of the toolkit (version 2) is provided for use with 
        MATLAB 5.3 or higher. It has been tested under Windows NT/98, Linux, 
        and HP-UX.

o       The entire toolkit is implemented as ordinary m-files and thus it
        should work equally well on all hardware platforms. A fast computer
        is, however, highly recommended

o       No "official" MathWorks toolboxes are necessary for being able to use 
        NNCTRL, but the Control System Toolbox is used in one of the demonstration
        programs ("lintest"). Although not a requirement, it is definitely an
        advantage if SIMULINK is available.

o       When properly installed, the structure of the toolkit is as follows:

        NNCTRL
	Basic directory containing different Readme-files and the following
	three subdirectories:
	
	    CTRLTOOL
	    The actual toolkit functions and script-files.
	    
	    CTRLDEMO
	    Initialization files, SIMULINK models, and mat-files used for 
	    demonstrations.
	    
	    TEMPLATE
	    "Templates" for the initialization files which are called by the
	    programs in CTRLTOOL directory.
		
        Your MATLAB path must include the directory CTRLTOOL as well as the
        directory containing the NNSYSID toolbox:

	>>  path(path,'/xx/xx/NNCTRL20/CTRLTOOL')
	>>  path(path,'/xx/xx/NNSYSID20')

        If the tools are going to be used frequently it is recommended that
        the path statements are included in ones personal startup.m file (see
        the MATLAB-manual).

        During normal use one begins by copying the initialization file
        associated with the desired control system from the TEMPLATE directory
        to the working directory. The file must then be modified to comply with
        the application under consideration. Typical working procedures can be
        seen by running the demonstration programs. Furthermore, the different
        text files in the NNCTRL20 directory provide supplementary information on
        this matter.

        When running the demonstration programs the working directory must be
        the directory NNCTRL20/CTRLDEMO.

o       The checks for incorrect program/function calls are not very thorough
        and consequently MATLAB will often respond with quite incomprehensible
        error messages when a program or function is incorrectly invoked.


CONDITIONS/ DISCLAIMER
By using the toolkit the user agrees to all of the following:
